Extensionparser is a PHP class for parsing Asterisk extension.conf files.
The parser reads the dial plan file and produces events for each dialplan
"component" (extension number, priority, application, etc) it encounters. 
This is similar to the SAX event model of XML parsing.

This library also contains "Builder" classes that consume the parser events
and classes that represent dial plan objects: Contexts, Extensions,
Applications and Menus. This could be seen as similar to a DOM XML parser 
which returns a finished data structure.

The examples show the interaction between "Builder" classes that consume parser
events and build PHP data structures from them.
